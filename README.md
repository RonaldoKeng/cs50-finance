# C$50

ðŸ‘‹ Heyo! This is C$50's Finance project for HarvardX's CS50x course. It is a simulated stock trading platform that gives users $10,000 to invest. I'm pretty sure I invested mine all in Apple AAPL so that's interesting lol.

It's hosted on a Python Flask server with a SQL database. It pulls real stock data using APIs (although it is no longer compatible). The frontend looks nice with Bootstrap.

This is how it functions: https://finance.cs50.net/
